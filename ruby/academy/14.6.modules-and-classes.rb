The Marriage of Modules and Classes

What we did in the last exercise might not have seemed strange to you, but think about it: we mixed together the behaviors of a class and a module!

When a module is used to mix additional behavior and information into a class, it's called a mixin. Mixins allow us to customize a class without having to rewrite code!
Instructions

Check out the code in the editor. See how we define the jump method in the Action module, then mix it into the Rabbit and Cricket classes? Click Save & Submit Code to see the effect!

module Action
  def jump
    @distance = rand(4) + 2
    puts "I jumped forward #{@distance} feet!"
  end
end

class Rabbit
  include Action
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

class Cricket
  include Action
  attr_reader :name
  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

peter = Rabbit.new("Peter")
jiminy = Cricket.new("Jiminy")

peter.jump
jiminy.jump
