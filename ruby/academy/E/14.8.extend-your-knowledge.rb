Extend Your Knowledge

Whereas include mixes a module's methods in at the instance level (allowing instances of a particular class to use the methods), the extend keyword mixes a module's methods at the class level. This means that class itself can use the methods, as opposed to instances of the class.
Instructions

Check out the code in the editor. We've extended TheHereAnd with ThePresent, allowing it to use the now method. Click Save & Submit Code to see the effect!


=end

# ThePresent has a .now method that we'll extend to TheHereAnd

module ThePresent
  def now
    puts "It's #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? Time.new.hour - 12 : Time.new.hour}:#{Time.new.min} #{Time.new.hour > 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM'} (GMT)."
  end
end

class TheHereAnd
  extend ThePresent
end

TheHereAnd.now
