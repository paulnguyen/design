Classing It Up

We'd like our classes to do more than... well, nothing, so we'll have to add some code between our class Person and end.

You may have noticed in our example back in the first exercise that we started our class definition off with a method called initialize. You can think of initialize as the function that "boots up" each object the class creates.
Instructions

Go ahead and define an initialize method for your Person class. No need to put anything in the method body just yet.

=end



class Person
    
    def initialize 
    
    end
    
end
