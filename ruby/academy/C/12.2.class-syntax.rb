Class Syntax

A basic class consists only of the class keyword and the name of the class. Check it out:

	class NewClass
	  # Class magic here
	end

Our NewClass has the ability to create new Ruby objects of class NewClass (just like "Hello!" is a String and 4 is a Fixnum). By convention, class names start with a capital letter and use CamelCase instead of relyingonunderscores.
Instructions

Create a class called Person in the editor. Don't put anything between class Person and end just yet.


=end


class Person
    
end
