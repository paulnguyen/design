=begin 

The One-Line Unless

You can do the exact same thing with 
the unless statement. The order is 
the same as before: something for 
Ruby to do, the unless keyword, and 
then an expression that evaluates 
to true or false.

Remember, you don't need an end 
when you write a one-line if or 
unless!

=end

puts "Good Bye!" unless false
